# Module 3: Preparing the Configuration Manager management infrastructure

# Lab A: Configuring boundaries and resource discovery
Scenario

A. Datum Corporation has expanded its operations, and you must configure two new network segments that the Configuration Manager infrastructure will manage. The first segment is in Toronto, Canada. The second segment is in Sydney, Australia. The Active Directory administrator has created the appropriate OU and site for the Toronto and Sydney locations, and now you need to configure an appropriate discovery method to discover new users and devices in these locations. You also need to configure boundaries to represent the Toronto and Sydney network ranges and configure the appropriate boundary group settings.

# Exercise 1: Configuring boundaries, boundary groups, and fallback relationships
Scenario

Your manager has asked you to incorporate new locations into the Configuration Manager environment. Your current Configuration Manager configuration already contains a boundary group named London. This boundary group provides automatic site assignment requests for client workstations that are members of associated boundaries. This boundary group also has LON-CFG.Adatum.com configured as a site system server providing distribution point services.
You must configure additional boundaries to represent the Toronto and Sydney locations. You need to associate these boundaries with an appropriate boundary group. The Toronto and Sydney locations will be used for automatic site assignment. The Sydney location will not contain any site system servers initially, but will be configured to use the London boundary group as a fallback for the distribution point site system.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

Configure boundaries.
Configure boundary groups and relationships.

## Task 1: Configure boundaries

On LON-CFG, on the taskbar, click the Configuration Manager Console icon.

In the System Center Configuration Manager console, click the Administration workspace, and then expand Hierarchy Configuration.

Click Discovery Methods, and then click Active Directory Forest Discovery.

On the ribbon, click Properties.

In the Active Directory Forest Discovery Properties dialog box, select the following check boxes:

Enable Active Directory Forest Discovery

Automatically create Active Directory site boundaries when they are discovered

Note: Do not select the Automatically create IP address range boundaries for IP subnets when they are discovered check box.

To close the Active Directory Forest Discovery Properties dialog box, click OK.

When you see the Do you want to run full discovery as soon as possible? message, click Yes.

Note: Before continuing, wait approximately one minute for the discovery to complete and for boundary objects to be created.

Click the Boundaries node, and then refresh the details pane. It might take a minute or two for the results to display.

Note: Do not continue until you see the following boundaries created by the Active Directory Forest Discovery method:

Sydney

Toronto

## Task 2: Configure boundary groups and relationships

In the Administration workspace, expand Hierarchy Configuration, and then click the Boundary Groups node.

Note: Notice the London boundary group in the results pane. This has been preconfigured for the labs in this course.

Right-click London, and then click Properties. Notice that AdatumHQ is the only member of this group.

Click the References tab.

Note: Notice that the S01-Adatum Site is used for site assignment for all clients that are part of the boundaries assigned to this boundary group. LON-CFG.Adatum.com is configured as policy and content location for the boundary group.

To close the London Properties dialog box, click OK.

Right-click Boundary Groups, and then click Create Boundary Group.

In the Name box, type Toronto, and then click Add.

In the Add Boundaries dialog box, select Toronto, and then click OK.

In the Create Boundary Group dialog box, click the References tab, and then click Add.

In the Add Site Systems dialog box, select \LON-CFG.Adatum.com, and then click OK.

Under Site assignment, select the check box next to Use this boundary group for site assignment.

To close the Create Boundary Group dialog box, click OK.

Verify that Toronto now displays in the results pane.

Right-click Boundary Groups, and then click Create Boundary Group.

In the Name box, type Sydney, and then click Add.

In the Add Boundaries dialog box, select Sydney, and then click OK.

In the Create Boundary Group dialog box, click the References tab.

Under Site assignment, select the check box next to Use this boundary group for site assignment.

To close the Create Boundary Group dialog box, click OK.

Verify that Sydney now displays in the results pane.

Configure fallback

In the Administration workspace, click the Boundary Groups node.

Right-click Sydney and then click Properties.

In the Sydney Properties dialog box, click the Relationships tab, and then click Add.

In the Fallback Boundary Groups dialog box, select London.

Under Fallback times (in minutes), change the Distribution point value to 10 minutes.

Click OK to close the Fallback Boundary Groups dialog box. This will ensure that if a client cannot find a distribution point within 10 minutes, it will fall back and use the Distribution point in London.

Click OK to close the Sydney Properties dialog box.

Results: After completing this exercise, you should have created and configured boundaries and boundary groups.

# Exercise 2: Configuring Active Directory discovery methods

Scenario

The Active Directory administrator informed you that a new OU named Toronto Clients has been created, and it contains all of the computers located in Toronto. You need to configure the appropriate discovery methods to discover all the computers and users in the Toronto location. User discovery also must include the Active Directory department attribute. You also need to use an appropriate discovery method to help you configure boundaries and boundary groups, which these new locations will use.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

Configure the Active Directory System Discovery method.
Configure the Active Directory User Discovery method.
Examine the discovered resources.
Prepare for the next lab.

## Task 1: Configure the Active Directory System Discovery method

Click New, and then click Browse.

In the Select New Container dialog box, click the Adatum container, and then click OK.

Verify that the Recursively search Active Directory child containers check box is selected, and then click OK.â€ƒ

On the Polling Schedule tab, click Schedule, configure the recurrence to take place every 3 days, and then click OK.

Verify that the Enable delta discovery check box is selected with an interval of 5 minutes.

On the Active Directory Attributes tab, in the Available attributes list, scroll down and click the department attribute, click Add, and then click OK.

Right-click Active Directory User Discovery, and then click Run Full Discovery Now.

When Configuration Manager displays the Do you want to run full discovery as soon as possible? message, click Yes.

## Task 3: Examine the discovered resources

Click the Assets and Compliance workspace.

In the Assets and Compliance workspace, click the Devices node.

In the results pane, right-click TOR-CL2, and then click Properties.

Click Close.

In the Assets and Compliance workspace, click the Users node. Notice the users that have been discovered in the Adatum domain.

In the Assets and Compliance workspace, click the User Collections node. Notice that the Toronto Users collection shows a member count of 5.

Click Toronto Users, and then on the ribbon, click Update Membership.

In the Configuration Manager dialog box, click Yes.

After the hourglass icon appears on the Toronto Userscollection, with the Toronto Userscollection selected, click Refresh. (You might need to click Refresh additional times until the hourglass icon disappears.) Notice that the Toronto Users collection now shows a member count of 38. If the number does not refresh, first update the All Users and User Groups collection.

Click the Administration workspace, expand the Hierarchy Configuration node, and then click the Active Directory Forests node.

In the preview pane, click the Domains tab. Notice that the Adatum.com domain has been discovered.

Click the Discovery Status tab, and then verify that the discovery has succeeded.

Click the Publishing Status tab, and verify that the publishing has succeeded.

In the results pane, right-click Adatum.com, and then click Show Active Directory Sites. Notice that three sites have been discovered: AdatumHQ, Sydney, and Toronto. Click Back.
